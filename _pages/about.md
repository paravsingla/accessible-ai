Hey friend, its me, Parav, the author of this blog. I have been working with Artificial Intelligence for about 5 years. But when I first started, it was nightmare finding the right resources which were accessible and easy to understand. While this may not be true today, since AI has really exploded in popularity over the last few years, there are a ton of resources for getting started. However, finding those resources in the sea of information is not an easy task for the uninitiated.
The goal of this blog is to make AI accessible - whether that is explaining the concepts that people struggle to understand in a better way, or just pointing towards a direction that is more suitable.
